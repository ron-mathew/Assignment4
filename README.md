This Java program simulates a deck of playing cards and provides various operations on the deck through a menu-driven interface. It consists of three classes: Main, Card, and Deck.

The Card class represents individual playing cards, each with a rank (like "2", "K", "A") and a suit ("Hearts", "Spades", etc.). It also provides a toString method to display the cardâ€™s details.

The Deck class manages a collection of Card objects. It can:

Create a standard 52-card deck.
Display all the cards.
Shuffle the deck.
Draw two random cards.
Distribute 5 random cards to three players.
Compare two cards for rank and suit.
Search for a specific card in the deck.
The Main class presents a menu for user interaction, allowing the user to call these operations. The program uses a Scanner for input and a loop to keep running until the user chooses to exit. It also includes proper input handling and closes the scanner before termination. Overall, the program demonstrates object-oriented principles like encapsulation and class interaction.
